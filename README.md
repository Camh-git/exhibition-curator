# Exhibition Curator

Exhibition curator is a react typescript based web app that allows you to browse several art museums and galleries and build your own virtual exhibitions from their collections.
The app consists of 2 main pages: the homepage and the "My exhibition" page, you can view your collection on the my exhibition page.

### How to use:

You can search the available galleries using the search bars on either of the pages.
To add new artworks to your collection simply run a search and click the + icon next to the artwork you are interested in.
Once an art piece is in your exhibition you can view it, and the rest of your collection on the "My exhibition" page, here you can click on artworks to see more info, or hover over them and select the bin icon to remove them.

To run simply navigate to the project's root directory and run the command: npm run start , the app will then be available at: http://localhost:3000/

## Notes from create react app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
