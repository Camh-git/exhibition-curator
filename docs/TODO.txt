Major:
    Integrate any more APIS
    Finish more info popup (last major point remaining)
    investigate the new issue with V&A images 

Minor:
    replace the "as any" in Convert_to_ArtObject.tsx with dedicated interfaces for each type of API object
    Investigate more options for ArtObject data, find a way to integrate them neatly into the UI
    add checks to stop duplicates caused by reacts double running
    consider re-ordering search results to put results with unknown values lower down 
    Add mechanism to search results to check if each item is already in the exhibition and set it's Added state to true if so
    Animated item added/removed pop up
    make the search result objects responsive 
     

Notes:
    the number of results returned from the met museum is intentionally restricted to 10 to avoid getting rate limited (it can return thousands of results otherwise)



REMINDERS:
    USE context to store search results, the user can then simply be sent to the search results page and it can map the context
        ^ probably use context to ensure the exhibition's contents are consistent throught the session
