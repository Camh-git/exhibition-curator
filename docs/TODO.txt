Major:
    consider using the VAMs built in search to look for search results, will hopefully only require an optional param
    Add the fetches for the remaing APIS, determin if they can be used to perform the search directly rather than searching a cache
    Decide if the above method is also a good way to get the data for "my exhibition" or if a cache would be more appropriate  
Minor:
    replace the "as any" in Convert_to_ArtObject.tsx with dedicated interfaces for each type of API object
    Investigate more options for ArtObject data, find a way to integrate them neatly into the UI
    add checks to stop duplicates caused by reacts double running
