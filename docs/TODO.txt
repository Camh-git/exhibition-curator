Major:
    Install issue - appears to be react hooks test not working with react 18 due to some ongoing integration

Minor:
    replace the "as any" in Convert_to_ArtObject.tsx with dedicated interfaces for each type of API object
     
Expansion:
    Integrate any more APIS 
    Investigate more options for ArtObject data, find a way to integrate them neatly into the UI

Notes:
    The number of results returned from the met museum is intentionally restricted to 10 to avoid getting rate limited (it can return thousands of results otherwise).
    Context is used to store the search parameters so that the user can run the search again by just going back
    Context is used to store the exhibition context to ensure consistency
