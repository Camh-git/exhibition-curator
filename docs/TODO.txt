Major:
    investigate the new issue with V&A images - seems to be fixed, some searches just dont have many images

Minor:
    replace the "as any" in Convert_to_ArtObject.tsx with dedicated interfaces for each type of API object
    consider re-ordering search results to put results with unknown values lower down 
    Animated item added/removed pop up
    change "updateContext" and its calls to "updateSearch" since its more descriptive

     
Expansion:
    Integrate any more APIS 
    Investigate more options for ArtObject data, find a way to integrate them neatly into the UI

Notes:
    the number of results returned from the met museum is intentionally restricted to 10 to avoid getting rate limited (it can return thousands of results otherwise)



REMINDERS:
    USE context to store search results, the user can then simply be sent to the search results page and it can map the context
        ^ probably use context to ensure the exhibition's contents are consistent throught the session
